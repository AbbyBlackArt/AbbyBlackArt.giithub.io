      <p>Born in Vermont and raised in Arkansas, I am currently pursuing a BA in art and a teaching license from Brigham
        Young University in Utah. In my art, I explore the commonplace and the familiar. I am intrigued by themes of
        change, progression, and impermanence and how they indicate life. I often revisit the same scene in my work,
        contemplating how, no matter how familiar we are with our surroundings, we never truly see the same scene twice.
        Light changes, shadows shift, objects are used and moved or replaced moment to moment. The spaces we inhabit
        become reflections of the lives we live and though they do not live and move and breath themselves, they become
        infused with the life and joys and curiosities of those who inhabit them. Through a range of mediums and
        approaches, including drawing, printmaking, and painting, I capture these scenes from my own apartment, seeking
        to understand and gain appreciation for the
        world in which I live and my place in it.
